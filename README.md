PHYLOGENETIC TREE DISTANCE CALCULATOR WITH A GRAPHIC OUTPUT                

This repository contains a phylogenetic tree distance calculator between clades (different species) using Biopython with dictated distances given in lower triangular distance matrix.
In order to use this, you just need to import Phylo from Biopython library as shown below:
